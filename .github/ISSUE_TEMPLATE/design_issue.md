## Summary

<!-- Describe the issue in a few sentences. -->

## Current Design

     Refer to specific files/lines or specific packages/methods where
     applicable. -->

## Problems

<!-- Discuss in depth why the current design is problematic.
     If the design fails to capture or embody certain concepts,
     elaborate on them so that others can also see the need for it.  -->

## Proposal

<!-- Propose how to evolve the design and code structure.
     If the problem has been solved in other (maybe outside) projects,
     or in different parts of the code, explain how they work.
     If there are multiple ways,
     briefly discuss pros and cons of each approach. -->
