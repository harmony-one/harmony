## Dev Environment Setup

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/<path_of_your_choice>

mkdir -p $HOME/<path_of_your_choice>/src/github.com/harmony-one

cd $HOME/<path_of_your_choice>/src/github.com/harmony-one

git clone git@github.com:harmony-one/harmony.git

cd harmony

go get ./...

git submodule update --init --recursive

```

## Build

Harmony server / main node:
```
go build -o bin/harmony cmd/harmony.go
```

Beacon node:
```
go build -o bin/beacon cmd/beaconchain/main.go
```

Wallet:
```
go build -o bin/wallet cmd/client/wallet/main.go
```

Tx Generator:
```
go build -o bin/txgen cmd/client/txgen/main.go
```

You can also run the script `./script/go_executable_build.sh` to build all the executables.

Some of our scripts require bash 4.x support, please [install bash 4.x](http://tldrdevnotes.com/bash-upgrade-3-4-macos) on MacOS X.

## Usage
You may build the src/harmony.go locally and run local test.

### Running local test
The deploy.sh script creates a local environment of Harmony blockchain devnet based on the configuration file.
The configuration file configures number of nodes and their IP/Port.
The script starts one local beacon chain node, the blockchain nodes, and run a transactional generator program which generates and sends simulated trnsactions to the local blockchain.

```bash
./test/deploy.sh ./test/configs/local_config1.txt
```

## Testing

Make sure you the following command and make sure everything passed before submitting your code.

```bash
./test/test_before_submit.sh
```
