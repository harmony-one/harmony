# TxPool design
---------------

## Functionalities

1. Being a storage of coming transactions
2. Managing all tx policies/filters (see below)
3. Handling logic of accepting new txs and generating a new block of tx

## Policies

### PriceLimit

This policy is to ensure that minimum gas price of a coming transaction should be enforced for acceptance into the pool.

### PriceBump

This policy is to accept a later transaction from the sender with the same nonce of an accepted transaction and drop
that accepted transaction if the gas price of later transaction is (100+PriceBump)% more than the gas price of the
accepted transaction.

### AccountSlots

This policy is to limit the number of executable transactions slots per account.

### GlobalSlots

This policy is to limit the number of executable transactions slots of all accounts.

### AccountQueue

This policy is to limit the number of non-executable transactions slots per account. The non-executable transactions are
stored in a queue data structure. See later.

### GlobalQueue

This policy is to limit the number of non-executable transactions slots of all accounts. The non-executable transactions
are stored in a queue data structure. See later.

### Lifetime

This policy is to limit the amount of time non-executable transactions are queued.

### DropOldTx

This policy is to drop all transactions that are deemed too old

### DropLowBalance

This policy is to drop all transactions that are too costly (low balance or out of gas)

## Data Structure

Coming up later.
